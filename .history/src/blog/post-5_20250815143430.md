I finally shipped this blog after a few days of wrestling with both technical details and some “what even is the right approach?” moments. Perseverance helped—and the tutorial’s design didn’t hurt either (cheers to the Astro team’s guide). I learned a lot, and I’m writing it down so future-me doesn’t forget.

## What I changed (and why)

- **Custom routes.** I personalized the route setup to fit how I want URLs to look. It’s a small thing that makes the site feel mine.
- **GitHub Pages via `docs/`.** I’m publishing from the `docs` folder instead of the default branch deploys. That meant tweaking the build flow so the final static output lands in `docs/` and Pages serves from there. Feels neat and very portable.
- **Not Netlify this time.** The tutorial suggests Netlify as an option; I went with GitHub Pages to keep everything in one place.

<details>
<summary>Build flow I used</summary>

```bash
npm ci
npm run build          # generates /dist
rm -rf docs
cp -R dist docs        # Pages serves from /docs
```
</details>

## Pages → Collections (and the file that trolled me)

I refactored from “posts as pages” to **content collections**. Big win: a schema that catches mistakes early and nicer APIs to fetch content.

But the gremlin: a filename. I had `[...slugs].astro` when the route expected `slug`—or vice-versa. One single letter cost hours. It happens. Lesson re-learned:
- The **param name** in `getStaticPaths()` must **match** the dynamic route filename.
- When in doubt, log the `params` you return and sanity-check your URLs quickly.

## What’s next?

- **Refresh the styling** with design concepts I’m currently studying.
- **Add a Projects section** so this doubles as a portfolio.
- Keep building—see where this little site wants to go.
